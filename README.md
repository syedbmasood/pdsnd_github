# Project Title
Bike Share Project - An **"Exploratory Data Analysis"** of bike share journeys in 3 major US cities.

### Description
A **web application** with easy to use GUI was created to enhance user-experience. This application is hosted on Azure Web Apps and the data was stored within a MSSQL database on Azure.
Users are supplied with a few choices to decide on what city, month and day statistics they would want to inspect. There is another option that allows a user to inspect raw data as well as a reset option. An error message will be displayed if a selected city does not have data available for a specific month and/or day.

> You can output statistics on trips such as:
* Total Travel Time
* Average Travel Time

> Station Statistics:
* Most common start and end stations
* Combination of start and end stations used most
* Total number of trips between the most used station combination

>Time Statistics:
